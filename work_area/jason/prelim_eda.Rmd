## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(bbplot)

options(scipen = 999)

homes <- readr::read_csv('./data/train.csv')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggthemr)
ggthemr("fresh")
homes %>% ggplot(., mapping = aes(x = SalePrice)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r kitchens, echo=FALSE}
homes %>% ggplot(., mapping = aes(x = KitchenQual))+
  geom_bar()
```

```{r mean Sales Price by Kitchen, echo=FALSE}
homes %>% group_by(KitchenQual) %>% 
  summarise(., avg_price = mean(SalePrice)) %>% 
  ggplot(., mapping = aes(x = KitchenQual, y = avg_price)) +
  geom_col()

# could have encoding og good/excellent kitchen (perhaps separate) and then combine Fa/TA)  

```
```{r one-way ANOVA test}
summary(aov(homes$SalePrice ~ homes$KitchenQual))
homes %>% count(KitchenQual)

homes %>% ggplot(., mapping = aes(x=KitchenQual, y=SalePrice)) +
                   geom_boxplot(aes(x = reorder(KitchenQual, SalePrice, median), fill=KitchenQual))
```







```{r neighborhood by Sales Price }

homes %>% 
  ggplot(., mapping = aes(x = reorder(Neighborhood, SalePrice, median), y = SalePrice)) +
  geom_boxplot()
# top 3 (NoRidge, NridgHt, StoneBr seem to definitely be a touch above others, through about 
# middle of pack seems to be another set, then from there to  bottom are somewhat close
#....bottom three perhaps should have a separate grouping too )

```
```{r avg sqft by Sales Price}
homes %>% mutate(., sqft_per_room = (GrLivArea/TotRmsAbvGrd)) %>% 
  ggplot(., mapping = aes(x = sqft_per_room, y = SalePrice)) +

# appears to be roughly linear -> curious about log transfomation
